# Attendance Web Application

# Demo link: `In-progress`

# Introduction
Create a cloud-based academic attendance system to track the attendance of the students. The whole attendance system will be based on `AWS` cloud. The server and the database are located on the cloud for a better user experience and easier access. Professors are allowed to create a classroom to gather all the students, so it is more convenient to call and roll many times during the semester. Features are well designed to make the attendance roll call more precise. The analysis such as attendance rate is provided for professors to learn the overall attendance condition of the whole class or a specific student.
